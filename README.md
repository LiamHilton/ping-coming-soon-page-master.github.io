# Frontend Mentor - Ping coming soon page solution

This is a solution to the [Ping coming soon page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ping-single-column-coming-soon-page-5cadd051fec04111f7b848da). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

- [Overview](#Ping coming soon page)

- [My process](#With this small challanege i focused on the layout of the page as i could tell from the get go that the process of styling would be down to having text-align: center in my main body class. alot of the process was down to a well structured html looking at the challenge from top to bottom.

- By scanning the challenge it allows me to process how everything will be laid out. In simple we have a header then a section with a class heading to specify the bulk of the page when applying the styles.
- By applying a heading section it enabled me to place ther main h1,p,input form and button in one section to help allign the page as they are all in the "center"
- The image came after which allowed me to create a seperate class to add specific styles to it before the footer section so that the icons could be individually targeted.
- I also set my primary colours and fonts in a :root folder to allow me to easily input them and is a constant practise now to improve workflow and saves time.
- In this prooject i played around with some gradients for the background and :hover on buttons to add a different style to the page that could give people ideas of how to set the background.

- An example of workflow for the input:

- things like margin-bottom, width and padding being key to creating a nice flow to then use on the button to match. padding-bottom also helped when i targeted .heading p to have a nice space in-between.

.heading .form-container input{
width: 100%;
margin-bottom: 10px;
padding: 8px;
font-family: var(--ff-libre);
font-size: 14px;
color: var(--clr-primary-blue);
border: 1px solid var(--clr-secondary-pale-blue);
border-radius: 30px;
outline: none;
}

- I was learning some JavcaScipt for the project that still needs to be worked on but i will add a commit shortly.

- [Built with](#VScode, HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Please provide a valid email address"_

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<section class="heading">
  <h1>We are launching<span> soon!</span></h1>
  <p>Subscribe and get notified</p>

  <form class="form-container" id="form">
    <input

      required
    />
    <button type="submit" id="button">Notify Me</button>
  </form>
</section>
```

```css
* {
  margin: 0;
